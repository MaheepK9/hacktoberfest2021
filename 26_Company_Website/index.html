		<h2><big><u>About Us</u></big></h2>
		<p><big>Hey there!<br>
			Have a passion for coding?<br>
			Then you're at the right place.<br>
		Here at Code Arena, we make coders for lifetime with our interactive coding programmes.</big></p><br>
		<p><big>Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time and effort to learn. Coding gets an unnecessarily bad reputation from people who weren’t persistent enough to practice. The easiest coding languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s a tiny sliver in comparison to learning a spoken foreign language. Once the easier languages are mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn other ways to code. Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug computer applications.</big></p><br>
		
		<p><big>Beginners starting to code must possess certain skills to be successful. Having strong attention to detail to pour over long lines of coded text is imperative. New coders need abstract thinking skills to visualize what written code will become. Novices must have problem-solving skills to persist against challenges without letting frustration win. Intuitive logical reasoning skills help coders correctly conclude why a code isn’t working right. Good writing skills are critical to creating code that appropriately conveys the intended message. Technology skills are also an obvious requirement for coders to fearlessly work with computer programs.</big></p>

    			<h2><big><u>Why Choose Us</u></big></h2>
    			<p>If you don’t know the first thing about coding, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve put together a beginner’s tutorial which will give you all the background information you need on coding, before you start learning it for real.<br><br>

				It starts with an explanation on the benefits of learning coding. Here, you’ll find out what you’ll be able to do once you know how to work with code. Then, you’ll get a deeper understanding of how coding works, and how the code you write gets converted into an instruction that a computer can ‘understand’. Very satisfying to know!<br><br>

				That’s followed by an outline of today’s coding languages. After all, every language has a purpose – some are for the web, others for app development, others for desktop software. You’ll find out why web development is an ideal form of coding to start off with, and then get a full overview of it. You’ll also be introduced to web design and app development.<br><br>

				Finally – and most importantly – there’s a step-by-step action plan that will outline the fastest and easiest way to get started in coding, and become a coder in 6 months.</p>

    			<p>Since the 1970s, computer experts have created more than 700 different programming languages. Each language has a unique way of helping computers process huge amounts of information. Every coding language has different features and terms with some overlap. New coders shouldn’t be overwhelmed by the plethora of programming types though. There are only about a dozen programming languages that are commonly used. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap, AngularJS, TypeScript.</p>

    <section id="fun_projects">
    		
    			<h2><big><u>Fun Projects</u></big></h2>
    			<p>If you're comfortable with the basics, you can venture out and create projects. The best projects end up being crash courses in coding themselves. They push the boundaries of what you already know and give you a practical exercise in whichever language you choose.<br><br>

				These projects are simple, even if they're not easy to make at first. You will walk away from with two things: a portfolio piece you can use to prove your ability and a better understanding of how powerful programming can be.<br><br>

				Some of these examples will use different languages like Java or JavaScript, but you can make them in any language you feel comfortable in.</p>

    <section id="career_guidance">
    		
    			<h2><big><u>Career Guidance</u></big></h2>
    			<p>The benefits of learning to code are actually quite vast. No longer do we live in a time when only tech professionals are using this useful language. Being able to utilize the commands of code yourself will enable you to have more control of the technology on which you depend.<br><br>

				For example, whether it’s for personal or professional use, more and more people are writing blogs and creating websites to share their message or skills with the world. Being able to understand basic code would allow you to make tweaks to the design of your site without having to pay a webmaster to do it for you or to wait for someone from IT to take care of the ticket you submitted ages ago. Knowledge of code can take you even further if you decide to pursue it. Some in-depth study will provide you with the skills to build a website to your own specifications and to fit your desired needs.<br><br>

				If you find you have a passion for technology and a talent for navigating the in-depth nature of computer languages, you could go on to become a professional coder and work for a tech company or even start your own business venture or launch a best-selling idea. The job market is opening up for technologically savvy professionals who have marketable skills in coding.</p>
